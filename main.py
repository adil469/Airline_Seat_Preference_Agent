#                     Exercise 3: Travel Planning Assistant (Intermediate-Advanced)
# Requirement: Build a dynamic instructions system for a travel planning agent that customizes recommendations based 
# on trip_type and traveler_profile.

# Adventure + Solo: Suggest exciting activities, focus on safety tips, recommend social hostels and group tours 
# for meeting people. 
# Cultural + Family: Focus on educational attractions, kid-friendly museums, interactive experiences, 
# family accommodations.
# Business + Executive: Emphasize efficiency, airport proximity, business centers, reliable
# wifi, premium lounges. medical_student/doctor
